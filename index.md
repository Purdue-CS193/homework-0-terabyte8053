Some of my favorite things about CS 19300 are
-the ability to practice using tools like github to understand how our cs skills can come into play
-application of what I am learning in Cs 1800
- just in general the random questions that are presented in the start of the class


## Random Thought experiment (looks blank otherwise)
- What is a Sandwich?
- Is a hotdog a Sandwich?
- If a sandwich needs bread than why is an ice cream sandwich a thing?
